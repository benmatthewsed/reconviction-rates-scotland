    "text": "People want to use reconviction rates as a performance metric\n“Reduced reoffending is an important objective that can facilitate desistance and reintegration. While reducing reoffending is important, in the absence of reintegration or desistance, reductions in offending are less likely to persist. Yet, reoffending can be a more quantifiable metric which has advantages – though care must still be taken as there are different definitions of reoffending” (Gormley, Hamilton, and Belton 2022). Basically it can help measure the ‘effectiveness’ of sentencing (… if imperfectly).\n“The ability to compare and discuss trends in reoffending is important to its usefulness as a performance target within government” (NI stats) - see equivalent from SG\n\nThe logic is that if the reconviction rate goes down then the criminal justice system is doing a better job at rehabilitating offenders\nBut, as NI statistics said: “differences in the offending related characteristics of those included in each cohort make comparing reoffending rates problematic, across both time and jurisdictions.”"

We decompose the overall reconviction rate by age and sex. These are key demographic characteristics in relation to the crime drop in Scotland (Matthews and Minton 2018). There is nothing particularly special about these time points, and the same approach would work for oither time periods.\nNote: include a figure of the overall reconvictions rate here\nNote: it’s possible to get data back to 1997-98 with different age categories. Not sure if this would mess up the comparison though?"

(Lundberg, Johnson, and Stewart 2021)\nA ‘unit-specific quantity’: at the individual level, what is the probability that a given person will be reconvicted?\nA ‘target population’: “over whom or what do we aggregate that unit-specific quantity”\nThe annual reconviction rate aggregates over the population who could have been reconvicted in each year.\nBecause of changes in the characteristics of the people who have been convicted change in the overall reconviction rate can be biased. The overall change we see will be both due to changes in the prevalence of reconviction amongst demographic groups, but also the mix/composition of those groups who are in each reconviction cohort."

This lets us separate out the contributions of changing demographics as well as changes in the sub-group reconviction rates to the overall rate.\nWe use the methods proposed by Das Gupta (1993) as implemented in the {dasguptr} R package."
