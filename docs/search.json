We decompose the overall reconviction rate by age and sex. These are key demographic characteristics in relation to the crime drop in Scotland (Matthews and Minton 2018). There is nothing particularly special about these time points, and the same approach would work for oither time periods.\nNote: include a figure of the overall reconvictions rate here\nNote: it’s possible to get data back to 1997-98 with different age categories."

The overall change we see will be both due to changes in the prevalence of reconviction amongst demographic groups, but also the mix/composition of those groups who are in each reconviction cohort."
