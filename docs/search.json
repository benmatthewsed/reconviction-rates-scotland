    "text": "People want to use reconviction rates as a performance metric\n“Reduced reoffending is an important objective that can facilitate desistance and reintegration. While reducing reoffending is important, in the absence of reintegration or desistance, reductions in offending are less likely to persist. Yet, reoffending can be a more quantifiable metric which has advantages – though care must still be taken as there are different definitions of reoffending” (gormley2022?). Basically it can help measure the ‘effectiveness’ of sentencing (… if imperfectly).\n“The ability to compare and discuss trends in reoffending is important to its usefulness as a performance target within government” (NI stats) - see equivalent from SG\n\nThe logic is that if the reconviction rate goes down then the criminal justice system is doing a better job at rehabilitating offenders\nBut, as NI statistics said: “differences in the offending related characteristics of those included in each cohort make comparing reoffending rates problematic, across both time and jurisdictions.”\nThere are reasons why we might not want to use reconvictions as a performance measure - but these are unrelated to the points we make here. That is, even if you think that reconvictions are a valid measure of criminal justice system effectiveness, the problem we outline still applies"

At least we can measure reconviction easily\n\nA ‘target population’: “over whom or what do we aggregate that unit-specific quantity”\nThe annual reconviction rate aggregates over the population who could have been reconvicted in each year. // take this from the demography literature\nBecause of changes in the distribution of characteristics of the people who have been convicted change in the overall reconviction rate can be biased. The overall change we see will be both due to changes in the prevalence of reconviction amongst demographic groups, but also the mix/composition of those groups who are in each reconviction cohort."

However, as shown in figure 1, when the data is broken down by gender, the 2002/03 rates for men and for women were actually the highest on record over the eight-year period … This can be explained in part by the fact that the proportion of women in the cohort has increased from 14% in 1995 to 16% in 2002/03 (Scottish Executive, 2001), and that women have a notably lower reconviction rate than men (37% compared with 47%; Scottish Executive, 2006b). That is, the sample now contains a higher proportion of people who have a lower likelihood of being reconvicted … This means that a headline reduction in reconvictions in line with targets might be due to a change in the gender balance of the incarcerated population, rather than the success of any policy or intervention. If the target for a reduction in the overall reconviction rate is met, and this is mainly due to more people with a lower likelihood of re-offending being brought into the criminal justice system and being convicted, rather than through a reduction in rates of re-offending among those who would normally be brought into the system, this would bring little cause for celebration.” (kirkwood2008?)"
